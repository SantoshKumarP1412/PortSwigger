## Solutions:

The POST /my-account/change-email request and notice that this doesn't contain any unpredictable tokens, so may be vulnerable to CSRF if you can bypass any SameSite cookie restrictions.

Identify the suitable vulnerable part

In the browser, go to one of the blog posts and post an arbitrary comment. Observe that you're initially sent to a confirmation page at /post/comment/confirmation?postId=x but, after a few seconds, you're taken back to the blog post.

Observe that the browser normalizes this URL and successfully takes you to your account page.

Bypass the SameSite restrictions

In the browser, go to the exploit server and create a script that induces the viewer's browser to send the GET request you just tested. The following is one possible approach:

<script>
    document.location = "https://0a040032041a40b885a86270005e0019.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=/../../my-account";
</script>
Store and view the exploit yourself.
